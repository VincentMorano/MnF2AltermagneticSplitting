Data and code for CAMEA experiment studying altermagnetic splitting in MnF2. After adjusting the directory locations you can run the FitDispersion script to generate files for SpinW. Next you can run the Figure 1 code from ManuscriptFigures, this will output some constant-E slices that will be used in MATLAB. Then you can run the sections of the LSWFitSpinW MATLAB script through the first Figure 4 sections to fit the spectrum and generate some panels for figures. Finally you can return to the ManuscriptFigures script and run the rest of it. There are some extra sections to the scripts that can be run and adjusted, related to e.g. testing a dipole-dipole model for the anisotropy.
